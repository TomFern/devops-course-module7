# Module 7 - Terraform Outputs

**Goal**: Initialize Terraform configuration to run on localstack

## Steps

1. This exercise uses the same files as the previous one, with one new file added: `outputs.tf`. Check the contents of the file
2. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
3. Preview the Terraform plan: `terraform plan`
4. If everything looks good, execute the plan: `terraform apply`
5. Compare the output of `terraform apply` in this exercise with the previous one. Is there anything new? What's the purpose of `outputs.tf`?
6. Destroy the S3 bucket using `terraform destroy`
